  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `category` on the `chronic_conditions` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `cid_code` on the `chronic_conditions` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `name` on the `chronic_conditions` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The primary key for the `disease_dictionary` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `code` on the `disease_dictionary` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(10)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `name` on the `disease_dictionary` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(255)`.
  - The primary key for the `disease_groups` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `created_at` on the `disease_groups` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updated_at` on the `disease_groups` table. All the data in the column will be lost.

  - Added the required column `disease_id` to the `chronic_conditions` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `disease_dictionary` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `id` on the `disease_groups` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
